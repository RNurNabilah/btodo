# BTodo App project for Front-End Module

This project consists of a seven members in team including me where we were assigned a task to create a web application as our final project.

This app is inspired by a to-do list app. Our approach is targeted for users who's bored or don't know what to do on their free time hence the name BTodo(Bored To-Do) came.
The app lists many possible activities for the users to do depending on the weather of the day.
